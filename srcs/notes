1. if we do not have enough space for the next portion of data -> overwrite the next block;
2. space blocks are huge -> no necessity to manage block vs little string collision (block size == 2, incoming string = 4 || str is bigger then the block or several blocks), len > block_size;
3. if we have the data type of size bigger then 1 byte, block_available = (end - current) / memory for the 1 unit of syze of the correspondent type;
